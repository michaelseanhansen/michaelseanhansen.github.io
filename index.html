		Hi, I'm Michael Hansen and I'm a senior software engineer at Google. I work on the Cross-device team for ChromeOS. We build features that help your devices work together seamlessly - such as <a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/how-chromebook-team-uses-nearby-share/">Nearby Share</a> which allows you to send files peer-to-peer between your Chromebooks or Android devices.
	</p>
	<p>
		I have 13-ish years of experience as a developer. Prior to Google I worked as a web backend developer for a number of years. Before that I built iOS apps. I've also completed a masters degree in machine learning. Please see my <a href="michael-hansen-resume.pdf">résumé</a> for more and feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect!
